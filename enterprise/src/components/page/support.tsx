                SPEX is a packaging solution that leverages web to connect restaurants / vendors to users seeking sustainable packaging.
                Single-use plastics have become the convenient means of packaging food for delivery.
                Ghana generates over 1 million metric tons of plastic waste yearly. 76% of these wastes are associated with food deliveries in Accra alone with approximately 250,000 MT entering the Atlantic Ocean annually.
                These single-use packages are relatively expensive compared to re-useable packaging over a long period for restaurant owners and food vendors
                Besides the cost single-use packages generate, they end up as waste destroying our marine bodies which negatively affects fisher folk who are predominantly women.
                Therefore, Smartpack Exchange(Spex) as a packaging service solution has been developed as an innovative means of eradicating single-use plastic packaging on our food delivery value chain.
